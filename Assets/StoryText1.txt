A droning whir can be heard in the air. A chill in your surroundings that can be attributed only to the unadorned, metal walls.
You wake up from what feels like an eternal slumber, still groggy and dazed.
A sense of dread is seemingly creeping up on you as the only noticable objects in your view are a door and the bed you are lying on. 
What do you do?

1. Get out of bed and check the door.
2. Go back to sleep.
