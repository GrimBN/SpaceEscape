  storyText: "You peek through the window and witness the vast emptiness of space.
    Bright stars on a black canvas that extends to infinity, distant planets and their
    satellites, numerous other celestial bodies littered about, appearing motionless
    to your relatively insignificant eye. A gargantuan and awe inspiring planet is
    also visible. You don't recognize the planet and it doesn't look hospitable at
    a quick glance. Though the view is entrancing, the fear in the back of your mind
    quickly reminds you of your current situation.\r\n\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n\r\n1.
    Enter the door to your left.\r\n\r\n2. Enter the automatic door to your right."
