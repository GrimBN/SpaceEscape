  storyText: "You open the door to an empty corridor with the same cold, metallic
    walls as the room. The lights are dim, barely giving any luminescence. Some light
    can be seen coming through a small round window to your right and just beyond
    that is what looks to be an automatic door. To your left is another door albeit
    not as fancy as the other one.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Look through the window.\r\n2.
    Enter the door to your left.\r\n3. Enter the door to your right, past the window."
