  storyText: "A droning whir can be heard in the air. A chill in your surroundings
    that can be attributed only to the unadorned, metal walls. You wake up from what
    feels like an eternal slumber, still groggy and dazed.\r\nA sense of dread is
    seemingly creeping up on you as the only noticable objects in your view are a
    door and the bed you are lying on. \r\nWhat do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Get out of bed
    and check the door.\r\n2. Go back to sleep."
