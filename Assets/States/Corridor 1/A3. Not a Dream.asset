  storyText: "You lie back down on the bed hoping to truly wake up. The eerie silence
    being betrayed only by the distant mechanical whir. You lay in bed for quite some
    time, your anxiety and heartbeat increasing by the second. You wonder whether
    the grinding sound is getting louder or you are just hallucinating. Alas, this
    is not a dream, and you realize that you may have just wasted some valuable time.\r\nWhat
    do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Get out of bed and check the door."
