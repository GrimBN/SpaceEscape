  storyText: "The other door was simple enough to open manually without too much effort.
    You enter a vertical room with a descending staircase. You start approaching the
    railing when you catch something with the corner of your eye even in this dark
    room.\r\n\r\nA corpse. A decidedly alien one at that, though still humanoid. The
    body is tall and lanky with small,glossy eyes. A small cavity is visible in its
    torso, possibly where the heart is, with blood inside and around it.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Descend down the stairs in the dark.\r\n\r\n2. Search the
    corpse."
