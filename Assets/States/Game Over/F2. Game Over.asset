  storyText: 'Before you could fall to the floor, you feel something pierce your
    chest. You can feel it moving where your heart should be, wriggling, squirming.
    You can feel a burning pain moving outward through your body as if your organs
    are being eaten alive. It finally lets you go. The burning sensation doesn''t
    stop as you are falling until you cannot feel anything. The sensation reaches
    your brain as parts of your body go from being in excruciating pain to completely
    numb. You no longer hear, see or feel anything and you only have one thought
    remaining in your head before your brain gets consumed:

    You are dead.

    Try
    again?

    1. Start over from the beginning.

    2. Exit'
