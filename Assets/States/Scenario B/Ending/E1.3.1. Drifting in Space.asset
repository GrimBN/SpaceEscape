  storyText: As you are in the middle of crossing the hole, the creature leaps out
    from it, catches you and slams you against the glass window. You hear the window
    crack as the creature stares you down. The sound of the window cracking continues
    and before the creature can finish you off, it breaks, hurling both of you into
    the vacuum of space. You tumble around in the anti-gravity, trying to breathe
    to no avail. You gasp for air but you can't - there is no air. Your body feels
    like it will explode into bits, an excruciating headache overpowering your senses.
