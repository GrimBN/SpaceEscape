  storyText: 'An eerie yet oddly calming silence fills the lonely vacuum as you glance
    at the last image your eyes will witness before you suffocate: the destroyed space
    station and its debris floating about in space. The thought of the bits and pieces
    of the station accompanying you in your last few moments of loneliness provides
    some semblance of comfort as your consciousness  fades completely.'
