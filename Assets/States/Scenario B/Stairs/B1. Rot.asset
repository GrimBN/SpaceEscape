  storyText: "With some hesitation but also considerable revulsion, you try to search
    the corpse to find something useful. Right as you touch the body, your fingers
    poke right through and blood starts gushing out of the carcass. A putrid stench
    fills the air as you realize that the corpse is completely rotten from the inside
    though its outwardly appearance betrays that fact. After a diligent frisking however,
    you are able to find a flashlight. Though alien technology, it still is just a
    flashlight. You don't find it too troublesome to figure out how to use it.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Descend the stairs."
