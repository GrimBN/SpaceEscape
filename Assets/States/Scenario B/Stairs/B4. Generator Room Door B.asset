  storyText: "You descend another flight of stairs to reach the generator room door.
    You run around your flashlight to find a way to open the door and find what looks
    to be a key-card slot. The door is made of metal and looks very sturdy so breaking
    it down is not a possibility. There isn't much else you can do down here for now,
    it seems.\r\n What do you do?\r\n1. Go back up one floor and go through the door."
