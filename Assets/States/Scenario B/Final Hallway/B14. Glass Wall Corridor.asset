  storyText: "The door opens up automatically to another hallway, perpendicular to
    the one you were just in. There is a tall and wide glass window that looks out
    onto the vast stretches of space next to a sign on the wall that reads \"Emergency
    Escape Pods\" and an arrow pointing to a door at the end of the hallway. Before
    you can get to the door however, you notice a rather large hole in the floor blocking
    your way.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Leap across the hole to get to the other side.\r\n2.
    Shimmy along a narrow ledge next to the window to get across."
