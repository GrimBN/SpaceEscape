  storyText: "You use the card on the generator room door and it opens smoothly. The
    creature's loud footstep sounds permeate through the ceiling and echo in the room.
    You look around and notice that the main generator is not on. You also notice
    a rather large hole in the ceiling. Did the creature make this?\r\nWhat do you
    do?\r\n1. Find a way to turn the generator on.\r\n2. Investigate the hole."
