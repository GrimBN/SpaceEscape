  storyText: "You turn the generator on and it roars to life. Unfortunately, so does
    the creature. It goes berserk and starts rampaging around the room, slashing and
    ramming everything in its vicinity in order to find you. You see a sliver of opportunity
    when it is in a far corner of the room to quickly leave.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1.
    Make a break for the door and escape.\r\n2. Make a break for the hole and climb
    in."
