  storyText: "You try to stay still and not make a sound, hoping for the thing to
    leave soon. Your heart starts beating faster and faster, so much so that you start
    worrying your heartbeat alone will give away your position, which only exacerbates
    the problem. The creature dawdles around for a while but eventually retreats back
    to the hole from where it came in. You wait a little while longer to ensure it
    is gone far away before breathing a sigh of relief. You turn on the generator,
    restoring power to the station and ponder over what to do now, though following
    the creature into the hole is not one of possibilities you are considering.\r\nWhat
    do you do?\r\n1. Follow the creature into the hole.\r\n2. Exit out the door and
    go back upstairs to the corridor."
