  storyText: "You explore the room and find a terminal at the backside of the generator
    that requires a key-card to access. You use your \"rightfully earned\" one which
    works like a charm. Before you can restore the power, the creature jumps down
    from the hole with a loud thump. It moves around slowly as if searching for something,
    possibly you.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Turn the power on.\r\n2. Wait for the creature
    to leave."
