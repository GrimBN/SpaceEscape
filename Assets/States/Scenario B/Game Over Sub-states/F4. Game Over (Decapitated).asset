  storyText: "You take the small opportunity and sprint towards your salvation. However,
    the creature notices you and proves too fast for your measly human capabilities.
    It pounces on you and knocks you down to the floor. You stare into its eyes and
    they stare back; embodiment of dark that they are as if consuming all light that
    enters them akin to a black hole. Their paralyzing gaze leaves you unable to fight
    back. Its multiple tentacles coalescing to form a sharp, clawed hand, it leans
    back and emits a piercing, deathly shriek that seems to echo across dimensions,
    before it swipes at you, slicing your head into pieces. You are dead.\r\nTry again?\r\n1.
    Start over from the beginning.\r\n2. Exit."
