  storyText: You inch close to the hole and point your flashlight at it. You see the
    ceiling of the room above you but not much else when suddenly, a tentacle swoops
    down and grabs you by your neck. It lifts you up into the air and starts choking
    you.You are having trouble breathing and are losing consciousness. Any attempt
    of yours to extricate yourself are futile. You almost black out before it releases
    you from its grasp.
