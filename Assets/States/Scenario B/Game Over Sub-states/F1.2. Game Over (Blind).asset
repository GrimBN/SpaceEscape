  storyText: "You stand up and point your flashlight at what you think is the creature's
    face. The horror of the thing being unfazed from the light is only secondary to
    what the light illuminated. Your eyes fixated on those dark holes staring back
    at you. The rest of its face being an undecipherable, writhing and shifting mass.
    The piercing gaze from whatever occupies those pitch black hollows causes you
    to freeze up. Your head starts spinning, you feel dizzy. You can't see anything.
    You've gone blind. A screeching ringing starts occurring in your ear. A chill
    slowly creeps up your spine as you feel that your legs might give way at any moment.\r\n"
