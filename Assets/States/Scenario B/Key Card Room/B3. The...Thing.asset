  storyText: "You enter the door and see...something. A creature? It appears to have
    several limbs, almost too many. Or are they tentacles? You hide behind the wall
    as it starts turning. Did it see you? Did it even have eyes? You saw some hollow
    spaces? Perhaps it caught your scent? ...Or the scent of that corpse on your body.
    The creature looked big but you feel like it is bigger. Was it hunched? It blended
    in almost perfectly in the dark. It seems to be making a continuous, deep, clicking
    sound. The sound is hardly audible, but you can feel its unsettling vibrations
    in the core of your body much more noticeably. \r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Move
    in to get a better look.\r\n2. Sneak around and try to find something useful."
