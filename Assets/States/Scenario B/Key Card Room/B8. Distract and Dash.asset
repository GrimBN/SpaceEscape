  storyText: "You couldn't see anything to throw on the table while you were getting
    to the corpse and therefore can't throw anything. As a last resort, you break
    away one of the corpses limbs. It peels apart rather easily and you chuck it down
    the room away from you. The creature notices the noise and starts moving in its
    distraction. You take this chance and run for the exit and close the door behind
    you. You can hear the creature shriek as it chases after you in a furious rage.\r\nWhat
    do you do?\r\n1. Rush down the stairs and use the key-card on the generator room
    door."
