  storyText: "As you try to crouch behind some equipment, all of a sudden the creature
    starts acting up. Smelling the air fiercely as if trying to find something, it
    slowly starts moving in you direction, its heavy feet \rrattling the floor accompanied
    by a sound akin to claws scraping metal with each step. You move alongside the
    barrier between you and that thing and turn along its end. You can see another
    alien corpse in front of a table, this one having a key-card attached to its
    suit.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Make a dash to get behind the table.\r\n2. Throw
    an object as a distraction to try and nab the key-card."
