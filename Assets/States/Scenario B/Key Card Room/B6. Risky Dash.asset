  storyText: "You make a break for the table as quietly but also as fast as possible.
    You are able to get behind it but the creature seems to have noticed something
    moving and it speeds up. You move around the back of the table and are able to
    reach out and grab the key-card, but the creature seems to be closing in on you
    fast. The door where you entered the room is not too far. \r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1.
    Shine your flashlight in the creature's...face? in an attempt to blind it.\r\n2.Throw
    an object as a distraction then make another mad dash for the exit."
