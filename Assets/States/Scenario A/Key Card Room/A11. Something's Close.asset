  storyText: "You grab the key-card and head back out the door. As you are leaving
    you hear a heavy thumping sound from above, each thump accompanied by what sounds
    like a claw scraping across a metal floor. Not wanting to find out what is causing
    this sound, you quickly exit the room and shut the door behind you.\r\nWhat do
    you do?\r\n1. Go down the stairs and try the key-card on the generator room door."
