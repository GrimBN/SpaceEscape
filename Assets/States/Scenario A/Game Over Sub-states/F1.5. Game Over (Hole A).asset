  storyText: You move away from the generator to find a light source. As you are tip-toeing
    around, your feet hit something. It is a flashlight! You are able to turn it on
    easily and start waving it around to get a layout of the room. You immediately
    notice a rather large hole right above you. Before you can do anything a tentacle
    swoops down and grabs you by your neck. It lifts you up into the air and starts
    choking you.You are having trouble breathing and are losing consciousness. Any
    attempt of yours to extricate yourself are futile. You almost black out before
    it releases you from its grasp.
