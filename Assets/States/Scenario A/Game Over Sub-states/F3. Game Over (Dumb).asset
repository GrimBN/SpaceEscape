  storyText: "In an extremely peculiar and exceptionally questionable move you decide
    to forget that banal worry of yours about your otherworldly pursuer and jump down
    for some good old fashioned frisking of a dead alien life form. As you are going
    about your delightful activity, the creature breaks through the door and catches
    up to you in blistering speed. The loud gasp from your person signifies your utter,
    UTTER shock and disbelief at how such a thing could happen. The creature immediately
    does some horrifyingly painful and traumatizing things to your body and leaves
    you for dead.\r\nThe end.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Continue from the last choice
    (This still counts as a game over though)"
