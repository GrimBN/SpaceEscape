  storyText: You dodge off to the side just barely, resulting in the creature to leap
    into the escape pod instead. You quickly slam the door of the pod close and launch
    it from a terminal in the room. The shrieking cries of the creature wanes as it
    jettisons from the station out into the vast stretches of outer space. Before
    the pod is lost as another blip in the endless beyond, it crashes into some floating
    debris and is destroyed, the pitch black creature lost in the all consuming vacuum.
