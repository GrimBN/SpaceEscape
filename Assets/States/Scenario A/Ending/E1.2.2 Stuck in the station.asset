  storyText: 'The floating debris catching you by surprise, you move back to the hallway
    to gaze out the window. To your horror, you see the rest of the space station
    in shambles: decimated parts of the station float about aimlessly in space, in
    front of a giant planet. You are standing in possibly the most intact piece of
    the station. The only thing you can do now is wonder how long will you be stuck
    here.'
