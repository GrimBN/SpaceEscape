  storyText: "It appears to have several limbs, almost too many. Or are they tentacles?
    It hasn't yet seen you. Can it see you? Did it even have eyes? You saw some hollow
    spaces? The creature looked big but you feel like it is bigger. Was it hunched?
    It seems to be making a continuous, deep, clicking sound. The sound is hardly
    audible, but you can feel its unsettling vibrations in the core of your body much
    more noticeably. It saunters its way to the door you entered from and stays there
    as if scrutinizing it. You notice a hole in the ceiling where the creature jumped
    down from. \r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Wait for the creature to move away and exit
    through the door.\r\n2. Climb into the hole quietly."
