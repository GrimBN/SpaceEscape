  storyText: You feel your way around the generator for a while and end up on what
    looks to be a terminal of sorts. It requires a key-card access which you provide.
    You are able to navigate the terminal and turn on the generator, restoring power
    to the station. But right as you do this, a loud thud is heard on the other side
    of the room, beyond the generator from where you are standing. Heavy footstep
    sounds soon follow accompanied by what sounds like a claw scraping across the
    metal floor. You try to get a peek at it, but even with the lights now on, the
    thing is darker than the pitch black of space.
