  storyText: "The wait for the creature to move away seems interminable but eventually
    it does leave its position. You get as close as you can to the door while staying
    quiet and out of the creature's sight...if it indeed has one. You are successfully
    able to open the door and leave. You close the door behind you but the creature
    has undoubtedly noticed this action as you can hear it charge at the door. You
    sprint up the stairs and reach back to the highest floor next to the alien corpse
    and the door to the corridor. The creature can be heard banging against the door
    during this.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Search the corpse.\r\n2. Take the door out
    to the corridor through to the automatic door."
