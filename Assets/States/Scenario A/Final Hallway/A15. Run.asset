  storyText: "Just as you take the door back out to the corridor, you hear a loud
    bang back from where you came; the creature broke through the generator room's
    door. You run over to the automatic door but strangely you don't hear the creature
    chase after you. The door opens to another hallway going perpendicular to the
    one you were just in, with a large, transparent  glass window allowing you to
    look out into space. A hole in the floor is in your way and just beyond it on
    a wall is a sign:\"Escape pods\" and an arrow point to another door at the end
    of the hallway.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Run and leap over the hole to reach the
    other side.\r\n2. Skirt around the hole carefully but quickly."
