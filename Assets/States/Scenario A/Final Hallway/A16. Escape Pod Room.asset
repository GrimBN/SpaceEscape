    escape pod room door. The door opens automatically to only one escape pod remaining.
    You hurry to open the door to the pod when suddenly the creature leaps up from
    the hole in the corridor behind you and charges towards you. Right as you open
    the pod door, the creature makes another giant leap towards you in order to catch
    you.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Climb into the pod!\r\n2. Dodge to the side!"
