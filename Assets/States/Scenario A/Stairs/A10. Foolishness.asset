  storyText: "In a particularly brash and boneheaded move, you decide to burst down
    the solid metal door. You back up to get a running start, charge forward and ram
    into the door with all of your titanic might. However the only thing that breaks
    is your spirit and possibly your shoulder as the door doesn't budge even an inch.\r\nWhat
    do you do?\r\n\r\n1. Go back up the stairs, your newfound embarrassment now accompanying
    your fear."
