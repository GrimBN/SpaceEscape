  storyText: You try to open the door to the remaining pod but it requires a key card
    access. You quickly shove the key card in the slot, open the door and climb in,
    narrowly avoiding the creature's appendage attempting to grab you. You turn on
    the escape sequence and jettison out of the space station. As you look behind,
    you notice the station being destroyed and in pieces. With the parts of the station
    floating about like the motionless stars, you wonder how you are going to find
    you way back home.
