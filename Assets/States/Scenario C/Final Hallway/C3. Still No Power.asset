  storyText: "The door looks similar to the one you saw in the corridor you were in
    soon after you woke up. It doesn't have any power to open automatically and cannot
    be opened manually either. Probably for the best, if it is in fact the same door
    as earlier. You would't wanna end up back at square one.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1.
    Check out the other door."
