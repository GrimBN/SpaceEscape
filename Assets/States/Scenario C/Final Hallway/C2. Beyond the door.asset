  storyText: "The hole opens up to another long corridor, with you facing a wide,
    transparent glass window that separates you from the rest of space. The scenic
    view would be mesmerizing if it weren't for the unnerving footsteps of the creature
    resonating in the hallway. You see a big door to your left and a sign that says
    \"Emergency Escape Pods\" with an arrow pointing to your right, in the direction
    of another door.\r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Check the door on your left.\r\n2. Follow
    the sign and check the door "
