  storyText: "Despite the no power in the station, the door opens up by itself. Perhaps
    a dedicated power source is attached to it to prevent the room from being locked
    in such a situation? Nevertheless, the room seems to contain the escape pods that
    the sign mentioned. There is only one pod remaining from the looks of it. All
    of a sudden you hear a loud thud from behind you. The creature looks to be climbing
    out of the hole. \r\nWhat do you do?\r\n1. Climb into the pod and escape."
